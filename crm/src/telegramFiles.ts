/**
 * The Telegram bot token travels INSIDE the URL of every file a customer sends:
 *
 *   https://api.telegram.org/file/bot<TOKEN>/photos/file_12.jpg
 *
 * That URL used to be stored verbatim in the `[IMAGE_URL: …]` marker of the
 * message, which means the bot token ends up in D1 — and in the dashboard
 * thread, and in every conversation export.
 *
 * With that token anyone can read every message the bot receives, reply as the
 * bot, and repoint its webhook. No access to Cloudflare or to the dashboard
 * needed: the text of a stored message is enough. For anyone reselling bots,
 * the token that leaks is not theirs — it belongs to the business they set it
 * up for.
 *
 * Rule: the token is MASKED on the way in and put back only at the moment the
 * file is actually fetched. Reportado por conconfianza (Escuela Con Confianza).
